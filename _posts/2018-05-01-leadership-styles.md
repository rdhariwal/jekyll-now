title: What makes a good manager

Over the last decade, I have had the pleasure of working with some very unique styles of management. Some things that did not impact the style is team size ranged from small to large, it would be easy to think numbers impact your strategy but the headcount rarely determined the success. At times consultants preached tailoring styles to the audience which was not a surprise, after all, you should know your audience. But I kept wondering if there was a deeper approach, that can create a structure rather than a checklist.

Before we continue to discuss the nitty gritty let's take a step back and imagine what does a great team look like

* A good team is productive
* A good team has a positive impact on its team members
* A team that is not static, a good team continues to stretch itself

Over time I saw two patterns emerge:
* Fear-based approach: Most young managers default to this style. They cling to metrics like velocity or hide behind buzzwords like agile to corner their team. Rarely do these measures co-relate with a successful team. 
* Inspiration based: These are rare managers, they understand a metric alone is a not a good indication of a successful ticket.
