In my quest for setting up a personal blog, I have traveled far and wide. For millennia (ok maybe not a millennium but I always wanted to say it) I have searched for a simple solution to manage my personal website. An easy to use platform, where publishing and hosting are easy.  And for a while, WordPress did the job admirably, but it always felt like an overkill. The updates, the plugins, the security vulnerabilities were just not time efficient.

Enter [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), it is a static site generator which is easy to use. Hosting is mostly free and I can focus on writing again.
