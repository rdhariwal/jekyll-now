title: Change is good
---


Something you hear often in books, and blog posts just like the one you are reading right now. In my quest for setting up a personal blog, I have traveled far and wide. For millennia (ok maybe not a millennium but I always wanted to say it) I have searched for a simple solution to manage my personal website. An easy to use platform, where publishing and hosting are easy. Like you, my dear reader, I want to focus on the contents of my blog rather than the platform. And for a while, wordpress did the job admirably but it always felt like an overkill. The updates, the plugins, the security vulnerabilities were just too much overhead. After all, I signed up for a blog, not for the job of server admin.

Enter [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), it is a static site generator which is easy to use. Hosting is mostly free and I can focus on writing again. Change is in the air, and I hope this one sticks.

ciao
