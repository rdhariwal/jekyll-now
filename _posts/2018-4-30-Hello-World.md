Something you hear often in books, and blog posts just like the one you are reading right now. In my quest for setting up a personal blog, I have traveled far and wide. For millennia (ok maybe not a millennium but I always wanted to say it) I have searched for a simple solution to manage my personal website. An easy to use platform, where publishing and hosting are easy. Like you, my dear reader, I want to focus on the contents of my blog rather than the platform. And for a while, wordpress did the job admirably it always felt like an overkill. The updates, the plugins, the security vulnerabilities were just too much overhead. After all, I signed up for a blog, not a server admin.

And I think I have found an acceptable solution. Static site generator ftw! If you are curious about what powers this blog check out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
